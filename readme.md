# SignalKit

SignalKit is an engineering reality dashboard.

It shows a small set of deterministic signals
that reflect what is really happening in a codebase —
without KPIs, people metrics, or recommendations.

## Philosophy
- Signals, not opinions
- Systems, not individuals
- One signal = one clear idea
- No noise

## Signals
**Time Sink** — how much engineering effort is spent on rework
instead of moving forward.

## Stack
- TanStack Start
- Bun
- Convex
- GitHub App
